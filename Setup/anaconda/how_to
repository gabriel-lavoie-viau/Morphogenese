I think you can find the solution you are looking for here.

    Open the Anaconda prompt
    Activate the environment you are interested in
    Type conda env export > environment.yml

In the yml you will find all the dependencies and you can use it to create a new virtual environment as a copy of the current one.

For example, on the new/rebooted machine, you can do:

conda env create -f environment.yml
